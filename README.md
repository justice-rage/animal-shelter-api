# Animal Shelter API üê±üê∂
#### Created by _Justice Douglas_
#### An Epicodus Bootcamp Independent Project
##### Framework: Ruby on Rails
##### Task: Build an API.

This API allows users to return animals stored in an animal shelter database. API users are able to get, post, put or delete adoptable animals within the database. Additionally, utilizing custom scope searching, users can return adoptable anaimsl based on species, breed, name, age, sex and even return a completely random animal utilizing the parameters shown below. Versioning and pagination (25 per page) are also utilized in the off chance this API grows.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- To run this program, you must have Ruby 2.6.5 and Rails 5.2.0 installed on your machine.
- Git clone this repository to your local machine.
- Once the project downloads, navigate to the root of the project in your terminal and type "bundle install".
- Before proceeding ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your local machine.
- Once PostgreSQL is installed type "postgres" in your terminal to activate it.
- Once complete with the above, open another terminal and proceed with the following terminal commands.
- Create new database: `rake db:create`
- Upload schema design to the database: `rake db:test:prepare`
- Ensure test database mirrors development database: `rake db:migrate`
- Auto generate fake data: `rake db:seed`
- Activate rails server: `rails s` 
- Navigate to localhost:3000 in your default browser to view API.
- Alternatively, download Postman(API platform) to test the example endpoints below.
- To generate new random database entries input the following command: `rake db:reset` -- NOTE: Turn of rails server prior to reset, and turn back on after reset is complete.
